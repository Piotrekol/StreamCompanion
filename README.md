### ![StreamCompanion](images/logo.png)
 **StreamCompanion** is a program directed towards osu! streamers, with functions such as a *pp counter* and *map information*

### Functions 
  - Grabbing song title **anywhere** you are in osu!  
  - A simplistic PP counter
  - Customizable map outputs
  - Key counter - how many times you clicked these 2 osu! keys since...(beginning of the stream?)
  - Play/Retry counter
  - Mods display
  - [osu!Post][osuPost] integration
  - Magic(and more)

#### Functions "on hold"
These used to be included before but I decided to remove them because of how horribly they seemed to work.
  - Twitch to osu! chat Relay
  - Built-in IRC twitch chat bot

### Help!
StreamCompanion now has a wiki explaining most of its functionality. [Give it a read][wiki] if you are having problems or wish to know what SC can do.

Any contributions / constructive criticism is appreciated 

## Plugins
StreamCompanion now supports plugins - they can access everything that any of the current modules can(get map data, osu! event hooks and more)
If you wish to create plugin/use SC for something and have no clue where to start - create a Github issue or ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/N854wYZ)
